# Digital Logic Simulator

## Overview
 
A digital computer stores data in terms of digits (numbers) and proceeds in discrete steps from one state to the next. The states of a digital computer typically involve binary digits which may take the form of the presence or absence of magnetic markers in a storage medium, on-off switches or relays. In digital computers letters, words and even whole texts are represented digitally. 

Digital Logic is the basis of electronic systems, such as computers and cell phones. Digital Logic is rooted in binary code, a series of zeroes and ones each having an opposite value. This system facilitates the design of electronic circuits that convey information, including logic gates. Basic digital logic gate functions include AND, OR and NOT. The value system translates input signals into specific output. Digital logic facilitates computing, robotics and other electronic applications. 

Digital logic design is foundational to the fields of electrical engineering and computer engineering. Digital logic designers build complex electronic components that use both electrical and computational characteristics. These characteristics may involve power, current, logical function, protocol and user input. Digital logic design is used to develop hardware, such as circuit boards and microchip processors. This hardware processes user input, system protocol and other data in computers, navigational systems, cell phones or other high-tech systems.



## Abstract

This easy to use logic simulator is valuable in both digital logic design lectures and labs. The environment is graphical in nature and allows the users to quickly build a logic circuit by clicking and dragging components from the reasonably complete library of gates and functions including: AND, OR and NOT. One of the useful features of this simulator is that it creates wire in different colors. This allows the users to quickly understand how the logic is working. These colors also indicate if the system is not working properly and also help to correct mistakes. The freshman students using this program for the first time have found it to be stable, helpful and in some cases even fun to play with the design.


## Background and Motivation

Digital Logic Design is a foundational course for many engineering and computer science students. The course includes laboratory projects in which students physically wire up various gates on a breadboard. It is believed that students' learning can be accelerated and enhanced by the effective use of logic simulation software. A student can connect a logic circuit in lab and observe its functionality by flipping switches and watching LED lights. Additionally, debugging circuits is often quicker with this type of tool, since all nodes are observable rather than just the inputs and outputs. After using different logic simulation software, the following list of desirable characteristics are determined by the users:
1. Easy to use windows program
2. Free or low cost
3. Allows to design complex circuits easily

## Description of gates

1. AND Gate

The AND gate is a basic digital logic gate that implements logical conjunction. A HIGH (1) output results only if both the inputs to the AND gate are HIGH (1). If neither or only one input to the AND gate is HIGH, a LOW (0) output results. In another sense, the function of AND effectively finds the minimum between two binary digits, just as the OR function finds the maximum. Therefore, the output is always 0 except when all the inputs are 1.

2. OR gate

The OR gate is a digital logic gate that implements logical disjunction. A HIGH output (1) results if one or both the inputs to the gate are HIGH (1). If neither of the input is high, a LOW (0) output results. In another sense, the function of OR effectively finds the maximum between two binary digits, just as the complementary AND function finds the minimum.

3. NOT Gate

A NOT gate (also often called Inverter) is a logic gate. Each NOT gate has only one input signal. Logically with NOT gates, the input and the output swap, so if the input 1 it outputs as 0. Similarly, if the input 0 it outputs as 1.

## How to use

User can make circuits in this software using basic gates. They will just select a gate and place it in the circuit plane. To send input to the gates, user needs to use switch. To see the output, user needs to use the output function. For wiring the gates, user should select wire button. If any selected gate is not connected, user will get an error message immediately. After connecting all the selected gates user have to select the run mode and then the circuit will function. To turn ON a switch, user just have to click on it (do same as to turn OFF). To delete a gate, user just have to press the delete button. Use clear button to clear the frame.
